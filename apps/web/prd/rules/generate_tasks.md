# Rule: Generate Tasks

## Purpose
Guide the AI or human collaborator to create a detailed, step-by-step task list from a PRD.

## Instructions
- Read the PRD and extract actionable tasks.
- Write the task list in markdown format with checkboxes for each task.
- Use a hierarchical structure for tasks and subtasks (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.2).
- After generating the initial list, ask the user if the tasks are correct before proceeding.
- Wait for user confirmation before generating subtasks or starting work.
